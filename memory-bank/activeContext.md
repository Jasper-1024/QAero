*Π: INITIALIZING | Ω: RESEARCH*

## 🔮 Current Focus
**Project Transition**: Moving from HTML prototype analysis to Kotlin Multiplatform implementation planning. QAero is identified as a privacy-first, open-source air quality monitoring client for Aqicn.org, emphasizing simplicity and cross-platform code sharing.

## 📎 Context References
- 📄 Active Files: 
  - `/prototype/` - HTML prototypes serving as UI/UX reference guides
  - `/memory-bank/` - Framework memory system with updated project specifications
  - **Target**: New KMP project structure to be created
  
- 💻 Active Code: 
  - **Current**: HTML5 prototypes with Tailwind CSS (reference only)
  - **Target**: Kotlin Multiplatform + Compose Multiplatform implementation
  - **Shared Logic**: Business logic, data models, API services in commonMain
  
- 📚 Active Docs: 
  - Detailed QAero project specification (Chinese discussion document)
  - Development phases and task breakdown
  - Privacy-first principles and open-source guidelines
  
- 📁 Active Folders: 
  - `/prototype/` - UI reference materials
  - `/memory-bank/` - Updated project documentation
  - **Planning**: KMP project structure (shared/, androidApp/, desktopApp/)
  
- 🔄 Git References: 
  - Current repository with HTML prototypes
  - **Next**: KMP project initialization

## 📡 Context Status
- 🟢 Active: 
  - Framework research mode completion
  - KMP architecture planning
  - Development methodology establishment
  - Task breakdown and phase planning
  
- 🟡 Partially Relevant: 
  - HTML prototypes (UI reference value only)
  - Tailwind CSS patterns (design inspiration)
  
- 🟣 Essential: 
  - Kotlin Multiplatform project setup
  - Aqicn.org API integration strategy
  - Privacy-first architecture implementation
  - Cross-platform UI component design
  - User-managed API key system
  
- 🔴 Deprecated: 
  - HTML/CSS implementation approach
  - Web-based deployment strategy

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps
1. **Phase Transition**: Complete research mode → Move to planning mode
2. **Project Structure**: Plan KMP project initialization 
3. **Development Environment**: Prepare Android Studio + Cursor integration
4. **Task Prioritization**: Establish Phase 0 (initialization) task sequence

## 🚀 Development Phases Ready
### Phase 0: Project Foundation (Ready to Plan)
- [ ] KMP project structure setup
- [ ] Gradle configuration with core dependencies
- [ ] Cursor + Android Studio integration verification
- [ ] Git repository structure for KMP

### Phase 1: Core Implementation (Planned)
- [ ] Data models (AQDataPoint, City, UserSettings)
- [ ] API service interfaces and Ktor implementation
- [ ] Shared ViewModel foundation
- [ ] Basic error handling with Result types

### Phase 2: UI Foundation (Planned)  
- [ ] Shared Compose components
- [ ] Android app structure
- [ ] Desktop app structure
- [ ] First data integration
